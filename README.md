# üêç Basic Python Projects

Welcome to the **Basic Python Projects** repository! üéâ

This collection of projects is designed for those just starting out with Python programming. Each project provides a practical way to learn fundamental concepts, work with different libraries, and understand basic software architecture (like client-server models).
